    "Large pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, GPT) have revolutionized NLP tasks by leveraging massive amounts of unlabeled data. Transfer learning involves first pre-training these models on large corpora and then fine-tuning them on smaller, task-specific datasets. However, fine-tuning all the parameters of a model like BERT is computationally expensive and inefficient, particularly when there are multiple downstream tasks\n",

    "# Adapter Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Adapters` are small, task-specific layers added between the layers of the pre-trained model.\n",
    "- Instead of fine-tuning all the parameters of the model, only the parameters of the adapter layers are updated during training for a specific task. The rest of the model's parameters remain frozen.\n",
    "- This method significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and, thus, the computational cost of fine-tuning.\n",

    "- Each adapter consists of a `down-projection`, a `non-linearity`, and an `up-projection` as shown in above image\n",
    "- The down-projection reduces the dimensionality of the intermediate layer activations, and the up-projection restores it, thus keeping the adapter small and efficient.\n",
    "- The adapters first project the original d-dimensional features into a smaller dimension, m, apply a nonlinearity, then project back to d dimensions. \n",
    "- so The total number of parameters added per layer, including biases, is `2md + d + m`.\n",
    "-  By setting `m << d`, we limit the number of parameters added per task.\n",
